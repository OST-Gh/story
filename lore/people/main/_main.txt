    Personality:
Background:
    - Discover magic abilities in an outburst, nearly killing two people
    - Mages are humans with essentially another heart on the right side, it causing them to have shorter than average breaths.
      Normally a human would use up their life-force in order to cast magic but, this heart enables a mage to cast magic without using oneself's life-force.
      Though this mutation is the cause for a lot of jealousy and discrimination.
      This heart means that a mage also has two pulses and two blood circuits which can be easily detected upon closer medical inspection, yet it luckily develops in an infant child not the fetus.
