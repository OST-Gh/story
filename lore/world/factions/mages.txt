The Mage Empire (short mages) are a large isolationist and pacifist grouping of mages.
There's been a gigantuan watch-tower on the fringes of their heavily fortified borders.
They've been isolating themselves because of a past, attempted anex caused, war with the empire which eventually ended with a cease fire.
