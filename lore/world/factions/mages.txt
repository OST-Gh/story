The Mage Empire (short mages) are a large isolationist and pacifist grouping of mages.
There's been a gargantuan watch-tower on the fringes of their heavily fortified borders.
They've been isolating themselves because of a past, attempted annex caused, war with the empire which eventually ended with a cease fire.
Another reason is the constant discrimination of mages in the empire.
