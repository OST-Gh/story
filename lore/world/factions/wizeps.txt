The Wizep people (short wizeps) are an ancient tribe of people who're now, due to a summoning, extingt.
These people were the ones who first discovered and or "cultivated" magic.
They also have created a powerful weapon (current accronym G.R.o.D.) and are the origin of the mages.
It also has been a known fact that they've waged a number of large scale wars with a lot of factions.
